# Why use E22P-868M30S

A completely new generation, coming out at the end of 2025 !<br>

This module adds a true RF front end module (RF FEM) comprising :
- A power amplifier (PA) up to 32 dBm at 868 MHz (see datasheet)
- A low-noise amplifier (LNA)
- Several surface acoustic wave (SAW) filters
- RF Ceramic Chips
- A high-precision active temperature compensated crystal oscillator

Compared to the previous old generation E22-900M30S,<br>
these modules significantly improve out-of-band spurious signal suppression capabilities,<br>
and offer enhanced anti-interference capabilities as well as increased receive sensitivity.<br>

The SF8301 is a Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) filter, commonly used for high-frequency signal conditioning :
- Center Frequency: 868 MHz
- Bandwidth: 10 MHz

SAW Filters provide high-performance frequency selection, effectively separating and filtering signals from different frequency bands.<br>
This ensures smooth communication between communication devices while suppressing interference.<br>
This is essential for use in urban areas with Cellular mobile networks.<br>
<br>
Several surface acoustic wave (SAW) filters in E22P-868M30S is a game changer !

<br>
Change of pin name from E22-900M30S to E22P-868M30S :<br>
- RXEN pin is now EN pin
- TXEN pin is now T/R CTRL pin

The EN pin must now always be set to ON.<br>
However, to ensure good confuguration, full power and reduced floor noise,<br><b>it must be grounded for 3 seconds during startup !</b><br>
