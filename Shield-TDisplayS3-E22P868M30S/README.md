# T-Display-S3

T-Display-S3 is a board whose main control chip is ESP32-S3 N16R8.<br>
It is equipped with a 1.9-inch LCD color screen and two programmable buttons.

It is very well known in the Bitcoin world, as it is widely used by NerdMiners !

Adding an E22P-868M30S LoRa module makes it look like the Heltec Vision Master T190 (HT-VMT190), but much better !
- Better LoRa module (much, much more power and sensitivity)
- Better LCD quality (The screen bus is 8 bits wide, which allows for greater fluidity)
